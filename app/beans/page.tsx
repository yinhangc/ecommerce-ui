    descriptionEn: `Brazilian Cerrado coffee is suitable for drip filtering and espresso brewing. It is highly beloved for its popular flavor profile, which includes the aroma of roasted walnuts and hazelnuts, complemented by a hint of caramel-like sweetness and rich chocolate flavors.

    This coffee is cultivated by thousands of small farmers in the Cerrado region of Brazil, located in the lush and diverse Cerrado belt, which is one of the largest coffee exporting regions globally. The area is renowned for its mix of grasslands, woodlands, and forests, as well as its fertile soil known as "Terra Roxa" (Red Earth) by the locals. The combination of high daytime temperatures and a dry environment makes the Cerrado region ideal for coffee cultivation at relatively low altitudes (around 1,100 meters) compared to other Central and South American coffee-growing regions.
    
    These unique qualities have granted the Cerrado region the first Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status in Brazil, similar to the protection specifications for Iberian ham or champagne. This means that coffee labeled as "Cerrado" must originate from the Cerrado region. For customers who appreciate single-origin coffee, they not only enjoy its distinct flavor characteristics but also value the ethics, traceability, and highest quality that it represents. Brazilian Cerrado coffee is a unique brew that will soon become an essential choice.`,
    descriptionZh: `適合滴濾和濃縮咖啡的巴西喜拉朵咖啡，因其受歡迎的味道特點而備受喜愛，包括烤核桃和榛子的香氣，再加上一絲焦糖般的甜味和濃鬱的巧克力風味。

    這種咖啡由巴西喜拉朵地區的數千名小農種植，該地區位於茂盛多樣的喜拉朵地帶，是全球最大的咖啡出口國之一。這個地區以大草原、林地和森林的混合以及土壤肥沃而聞名，當地人稱之為“Terra Roxa”（紅土）。加上高白天溫度和乾燥的地區環境，這些種植條件使得喜拉朵地區相對於其他中美洲和南美洲的咖啡來說，在較低海拔（約1,100米）種植咖啡非常理想。
    
    這些獨特的品質使得喜拉朵成為巴西首個獲得原產地保護地位的地區，這意味著標有“Cerrado”標籤的咖啡必須來自喜拉朵地區（類似於保護伊比利亞火腿或香檳的規定） 。對於那些欣賞單一產地咖啡的顧客來說，他們不僅欣賞其獨特的風味特點，還欣賞其代表的倫理、可追溯和最高品質的咖啡。巴西喜拉朵咖啡是一款獨特的咖啡，很快就會成為必備的選擇。`,

Prior to the 1990s, coffee was classified as Santos 1, Santos 2, Santos 3, and so on. Although the grading system has since changed, the name Santos has been preserved due to its good reputation.

    As the world's largest coffee-producing country, Brazil has a wide variety of coffee species and production conditions. Every year, a range of high-quality coffees is produced, allowing for the continuous supply of high-quality blended coffee. Brazilian Santos is known for its sweet and smooth taste, making it highly popular. It has a medium-bodied texture and a mild flavor reminiscent of cream. Due to its consistent characteristics, this coffee serves as an excellent foundation for any blend, allowing you to savor the beloved flavor over and over again.`,
    descriptionZh: `在巴西，桑托斯（Santos）正在著手建造高品質的咖啡。這個名字源自桑托斯港口，該港口一直是巴西最大的咖啡出口港口之一。在1990年代之前，咖啡被分成桑托斯1號、桑托斯2號、桑托斯3號等。雖然分級制度此後發生了改變，但桑托斯這個名字借鑒了良好的系統而保留至今。

    作為全球最大的咖啡生產國，巴西擁有非常廣泛的品種和生產條件，每年咖啡生產一系列供給選擇的優質咖啡，使得持續提供高品質的混合咖啡成為可能。巴西桑托斯恢復清醒而順滑的口感而聞名，廣受歡迎，具有中等酒精厚重的口感和奶油般的溫和風味。由於提供瞭如此一致的特點，這種咖啡是任何混合咖啡的絕佳基礎，讓您再次回味相同心愛的風味。`,

It is a rare variety with a complex origin: it is a hybrid of Sarchimor and Mundo Novo. Mundo Novo is a cross between Bourbon and Typica, known as the New World variety. This plant has relatively high nutrient requirements but produces a high yield and is resistant to coffee rust, making it increasingly popular among coffee farmers. In terms of taste, the Obata variety is a clean and balanced coffee with delicate yet pronounced acidity, which makes it impressive due to its unique flavor. The volcanic soil characteristics of Costa Rica seem to have a particularly positive impact on this variety.`,

    descriptionEn: `Medellín is a trading city in the Antioquia region of Colombia, located in the northwest of the capital city, Bogotá. It is one of the larger coffee-producing areas in Colombia. The region produces the majority of Colombian coffee, which is graded based on bean size. This grading includes various classifications of Excelso, ranging from screen sizes 14 to 16.5, as well as Supremo, with a screen size above 17. Therefore, Supremo is the largest coffee bean, apart from a small portion known as "elephant beans" or Maragogype, which is a minor part of Colombia's production. Medellín coffee has a medium body and is typically not as fruity/winey as coffee from other regions in Colombia. This coffee has a balanced flavor and can be enjoyed at any time. The coffee harvesting season in this area runs from September to December, and it generally arrives in the United States in early to late spring.

    The farms are situated at altitudes ranging from around 5,200 to 6,000 feet. The ripe coffee cherries are mostly handpicked by women in the region, then undergo traditional wet fermentation processing. They are washed using a series of channels with pure mountain spring water and finally dried on patios. Supremo coffee beans are large and uniform, with over 90% of the beans exceeding screen size 18.
    
    Supremo coffee beans are a combination of many small landowners and can be used to create simple, clean, and versatile coffee. They can be used as single-origin coffee, blended with other ingredients to enhance brightness and mildness, or for dark roasting. These beans have high density, durability, and larger particles.`,
    descriptionZh: `梅德琳是安提奧基亞州的一個貿易城市，位於首都波哥大的西北部，是哥倫比亞較大的咖啡產區之一。該地區生產了大部分以豆子大小分級的哥倫比亞咖啡。這些大小包括各種Excelso的分類，可以是14到16.5號篩網，以及Supremo，螢幕大小為17號以上。因此，Supremo是最大的咖啡豆，除了被稱為「大象豆」的Maragogype，這是哥倫比亞產量的一小部分。梅德琳咖啡具有中等口感，通常不像來自哥倫比亞其他地區的咖啡那樣具有水果/葡萄酒味。這種咖啡口感平衡，可以在任何時間享用。該地的咖啡收穫季節為9月至12月，美國一般在春季早期至晚春季到貨。

    農場海拔一般在大概5200至6000英尺之間。成熟的咖啡漿果由該地區的大多數婦女手工採摘，然後經過傳統發酵濕法處理，在純淨的山泉水中使用一系列渠道進行洗滌，最後在露台上晾曬。 Supremo咖啡豆大而均勻，90%的豆子篩網尺寸超過18號。
    
    Supremo咖啡豆是由許多小地主合併而成，可以製作簡單、乾淨和多用途的咖啡。它們可以用作單品咖啡，混合配料以增加明亮度和溫和的口感，也可以用於深烘焙。它們密度高，耐久且顆粒較大。`,

Caturra is a dwarf variety, meaning that it is shorter in stature compared with other coffee plants. This makes it easier to maintain and harvest, which is one of the reasons why it's so popular.

    The Caturra varietal is known for generally having bright acidity, balanced body, and a nice complexity. It also can have a sweet aftertaste, making it well sought after by coffee buyers.`,

    Caturra品種通常以明亮的酸度、中等的酒體和良好的複雜性而聞名。它還可能具有甜美的餘韻，這使得它備受咖啡買家追捧。`,

There are 89 farmers in this group, each are responsible for the full management of their farm, picking the coffee themselves and only asking for help from their neighbours when needed.

    During the harvest the coffee is picked, depulped and left to ferment for between 16 to 18 hours. Next day the coffee is washed and is then ready for drying. The group members have different drying methods. Some have drying platforms on the roof of the house;others have raised drying beds with a rail system; the rest have a parabolic tents for drying the coffee for between 10-14 days depending on the climate.

    收穫期間，咖啡被採摘、去果肉並發酵 16 至 18 小時。第二天，咖啡被清洗並準備乾燥。小組成員有不同的乾燥方法。有些在屋頂上有乾燥平台；有些則有帶軌道系統的高架乾燥床；有些則在屋頂上設有乾燥平台。其餘的則設有拋物線形帳篷，根據氣候狀況將咖啡乾燥 10 至 14 天。
    
    然後他們得到馬尼薩萊斯合作社的支持，該合作社幫助根據品質評估和分離咖啡豆。生產者可以獲得優質咖啡豆的額外報酬。對於向合作社提供水分低於 11% 的咖啡的生產商來說，還有額外的溢價。`,
